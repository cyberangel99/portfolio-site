I have a sense of passion and love for designing and developing web pages. I currently love using Uikit frameworks but I also dabbled in bootstrap as well. I love the clean, modern design of web pages nowadays.</p> 
<p>I live in Houston, Texas with my boyfriend and we are new to this beautiful metro area.</p> 
<p>I have projects coming soon for my portfolio, until then, please review my Github for my source code.</p>
