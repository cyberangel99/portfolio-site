My name is Mary and thanks for visiting my site! Why don't you stay for awhile? ;) You'll learn that I have a love for developing websites. I currently use Uikit frameworks but I also dabbled in bootstrap as well. I love the clean, single page, modern design of web pages nowadays.</p> 
            <p>I am working on projects for my portfolio, please review portfolio and my Github for my source code.</p>
